#  Customer Analysis Project

### Project Overview
---
This project involves analyzing customer data to identify states with the highest customer engagement or sales. Utilizing SQL queries, the analysis categorizes states based on customer counts into three segments: 'better', 'need_more_marketing', and 'bad'. The insights gained from this analysis inform targeted marketing strategies and resource allocation for business growth.

### Data Source
---

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including their state of residence and segment. It likely includes fields such as:

- State: The state where the customer resides.
- Segment: The segment to which the customer belongs (e.g., 'Consumer', 'Corporate', 'Home Office').

### Tools 
---
- PostgreSQL- Used for storing and querying the customer dataset 
- pgAdmin- A software environment used for writing, testing, and executing SQL queries. 
- Excel for data cleaning
- Tableau for data for creating a dashboard and reporting

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
**Excel**

- Import dataset.

- Export cleaned dataset.
  
**Tableau**

- Connect to cleaned dataset.
- Explore and visualize data.
- Perform additional cleaning or transformation if needed.
- Design visualizations.
- Share insights through interactive dashboards.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---
- Which states have the highest number of customers in the 'Consumer' segment?
- What is the distribution of customers across different states?
- Which states need more marketing efforts to increase customer engagement?
- Are there any states where customer engagement is particularly low, indicating potential areas for improvement?
- What are the key insights derived from the customer segmentation analysis that can inform strategic decision-making for business growth?

### Data Analysis
---
```slq
SELECT state, COUNT (segment) AS number_of_customers_per_state, 
(CASE WHEN COUNT (segment)> 10 THEN 'better'
     WHEN COUNT (segment)> 5 THEN 'need_more_marketing'
	 ELSE 'bad' END) AS ranking_of_states
FROM customer
WHERE segment = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY number_of_customers_per_state DESC;
```
### Results/Findings
---
- **Highest Customer States**: The analysis revealed that states such as California, Texas, and New York have the highest number of customers in the 'Consumer' segment.

- **Distribution Across States**: The customer distribution across different states varies significantly, with some states having a larger customer base compared to others.

- **Marketing Focus States**: States such as Florida, Illinois, and Georgia were identified as needing more marketing efforts to increase customer engagement, as they showed lower customer counts compared to other states.

- **Low Engagement States**: States like Wyoming, Vermont, and Montana were found to have particularly low customer engagement, indicating potential areas for improvement in marketing strategies or customer outreach initiatives.

- **Strategic Insights**: Overall, the analysis provided valuable insights into customer distribution patterns across states, highlighting key areas for targeted marketing campaigns and strategic decision-making to optimize business growth.

### Recommendations
---
- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Focus marketing efforts on states with the highest number of customers, such as California, Texas, and New York, to maximize customer engagement and retention.

- **Regionalized Marketing Strategies**: Develop region-specific marketing strategies tailored to states needing more marketing efforts, such as Florida, Illinois, and Georgia, to effectively target and attract customers in these areas.

- **Improved Outreach Initiatives**: Implement targeted outreach initiatives in states with low customer engagement, such as Wyoming, Vermont, and Montana, to increase brand awareness and drive customer acquisition.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Continuously monitor and analyze customer distribution patterns to identify emerging trends and adjust marketing strategies accordingly, ensuring a proactive and data-driven approach to decision-making.

- **Customer Segmentation Refinement**: Further refine customer segmentation strategies based on geographical location and other relevant factors to better understand regional preferences and behavior, enabling personalized marketing approaches for enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.
